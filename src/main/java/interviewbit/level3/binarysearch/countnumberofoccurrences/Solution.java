/*
Given a sorted array of integers, find the number of occurrences of a given target value.
Your algorithmâ€™s runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).
If the target is not found in the array, return 0

**Example : **
Given [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10] and target value 8,
return 2.

PROBLEM APPROACH :

For complete solution, look at the hint.
